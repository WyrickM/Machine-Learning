# Machine-Learning

## Machine Learning Assignments
**HW1** Implement Decision Tree<br>
**HW2** Comparing 4 classifiers: decision tree, k nearest neighbor, majority classifier, self implemented KNN<br>
**HW3.1** Ranking algorithms <br>
**HW3.2** K-means clustering. (Personal favorite!) <br>
**HW4** Naive Bayes classifier <br>
**HW5** Neural network, specifically self implementation of back propogation <br>
**HW6.1** Reinforcemnet learning: Q-learning with "frozen lake" game<br>
**HW6.2** Design and compare 3 CNNs<br>
<br>

## Semester Project
Partner project where we fully designed a RNN and GAN to generate classic rock music. Gave the networks midi files as data.

### NOTE: 
All of this code was generated in google colab, might not run outside of google colab without any modifications to the code. If you want to try to run it yourself you might need some files from me.
